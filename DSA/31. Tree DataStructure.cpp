What is a Tree Data Structure ?
A tree is a non linear data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure with a root value and 
sub trees of children with parent node, represented as set of linked nodes.


--------------- Tree terms--------------

1.Root - Root is a special node in a tree. The entire tree is referenced through it. It does not have a parent.
2.Parent Node - Parent node is an immediate predecessor of a node.
3.Child Node - All immediate successors of a node are its children.
4.Siblings - Nodes with the same parent are called Siblings.
5.Leaf - Last node in the tree. There is no node after this node.
6.Edge - Edge is a connection between one node to another. It is a line between two nodes or a node and a leaf.
7.Path - Path is a number of successive edges from source node to destination node.




------------ Tree terms / properties --------

Tree can be termed as a RECURSIVE data structure.
In a valid tree for N Nodes we have N-1 Edges/Links
Depth of Node - Depth of a node represents the number of edges from the treeâ€™s root node to the node.
Height of Node - Height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node & a leaf.
Height of Tree - Height of tree represents the height of its root node.



 ------------- Types of Trees -------------

1.General Tree
2.Binary Tree
3.Binary Search Tree
4.AVL Tree
5.Spanning Tree
6.B-Tree
7.B+ Tree
8.Heap




----------------Applications of Tree Data Structure ----------------

1.Store hierarchical data, like folder structure, organization structure data.
2.Binary Search Tree is a tree that allows fast search, insert, delete on a sorted data.
3.Heap is a tree data structure which is implemented using arrays and used to implement priority queues.
4.B-Tree and B+ Tree are used to implement indexing in databases.
5.Used to store router-tables in routers.
6.Used by compilers to build syntax trees.
7.Used to implement expression parsers and expression solvers.
